<h3>in 1913, Elisabeth Bennet is credited with saving many lives in the worst fire  in Manchester's history, the Ninth District School Fire. The school burned to the ground in less than an hour. Regular fire drills were praised as the reason that the school emptied quickly and not a single child was killed. About 1,100 children were in the building that afternoon.</h3>
